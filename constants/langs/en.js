    section1Description: "Artificial Intelligence is transforming society, but it also has a hidden environmental impact that is rarely mentioned. Generative Sustainability was created to show that technology can progress and be used while still caring for the planet. Contrary to what some people believe, the environmental impact of AI is not limited to those who develop it, it also affects the people who use it. Our work focuses on researching the real energy consumption associated with AI use, raising awareness in society about its responsible use, and teaching simple tips to apply it in an environmentally friendly way. We want young people, adults, and developers of new AI-based technologies to discover that there are simple and effective ways to reduce the impact without giving up innovation.",

It allows us to solve daily and complex tasks, increases efficiency in multiple sectors and promises to accelerate humanity's development at an unprecedented pace. However, along with these opportunities, important challenges also emerge such as its impact on the labor market, the decrease of our cognitive abilities, the increase of the economic gap between countries with access to technology or misinformation. However, there is a less visible impact and perhaps more difficult to perceive by the user (although as we will see, it has an important role): the environmental impact. Training and maintaining AI systems requires enormous amounts of energy and natural resources, raising urgent questions about sustainability.

      body: "Any artificial intelligence system works in two main phases. To understand it, we present the case of a chatbot, but it would be very similar for any type of AI:",
      li1: "<strong>Training phase.</strong> The model learns from huge amounts of text and data, detecting patterns and relationships between words and concepts. It's as if it were reading millions of books and articles to understand how sentences are constructed and how information is connected. As a result, we obtain a system that is capable of answering questions. This phase is only executed once, but can last a long time. The final result is a 'program' (called a model) that can be installed on machines that have sufficient resources to run them. The most popular chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) run in large data centers, but there are models that we can run on powerful personal computers",
      li2: "<strong>Inference phase.</strong> The trained model is installed in data centers to serve all users. In reality, not a single model is installed, but there are many versions of it running in parallel to serve all users. When a user asks a question (inference) the model runs and responds with the knowledge it has acquired in the training phase, or by consulting external sources in case it is connected to the Internet. For example, if we ask about cooking recipes, it combines its previous knowledge to give clear step-by-step instructions. Everything happens in real time, like a 'dialogue' adapted to what is requested. Unlike the training phase, the inference phase is executed as many times as necessary to obtain the answer.",

Usually, we talk about <strong>energy consumed</strong>, that is, the power needed to run the models multiplied by the operating time. This information is the same as obtained in the home electricity bill. Often the measure of <strong>kg of CO₂ equivalent</strong> is also used, which estimates the amount of carbon dioxide released to generate that electricity. This calculation depends on the energy source: a country with predominance of renewable energies will have much lower emissions than another that depends mainly on non-renewable energies such as coal. However, AI's impact is not limited to energy consumption. We must consider the entire product life cycle and the actors involved. Some important aspects include:",

      body: "This report focuses on the impact of AI use and not on training since it is the impact that depends on people's use. To know the impact that generative AI has, it is necessary to understand a basic aspect of its operation. AI does not generate all content at once, but generates word by word (actually word fragments that in the AI world are known as tokens). This is relevant, because to generate a text of 1,000 tokens you need to execute the model 1,000 times. Recently there have been works from the companies that develop the models in which they have evaluated their environmental impact. For example, <a class='underline' target='_blank' href='https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/measuring_the_environmental_impact_of_delivering_ai_at_google_scale.pdf'>Google</a> estimates that a text query to Gemini means the same energy as watching television for 9 seconds. In a similar study at <a class='underline' target='_blank' href='https://mistral.ai/news/our-contribution-to-a-global-environmental-standard-for-ai'>Mistral</a> they found that generating a page of text with the Large 2 model means the same consumption as watching a streaming series in the US for 10 seconds. Measuring all factors that produce an environmental impact is a complex technological challenge, in fact, there is no consensus on the exact magnitude of the effect that AI has on the planet.",
      body2: "A fundamental aspect to know the environmental impact of AI is the size of the models.

Today, there are smaller models that can even run on personal computers with sufficient resources, although they are not usually the ones used for more complex or large-scale tasks. This means that, in theory, energy consumption could be reduced by using lighter versions, but daily practice usually requires large models that demand more energy. In addition, important advances have been developed to save energy in infrastructure. For example, data centers incorporate advanced cooling systems, reuse the heat generated through thermal batteries and use more efficient servers that consume less electricity for the same processing. However, despite improvements in efficiency, the use of artificial intelligence is growing at an accelerated pace, which increases both its use and its environmental impact.

      description1: "In the shadows of cyberspace, a group of <strong>four cybercriminals</strong> scattered around the world has developed an unprecedented computer virus. Their goal: <strong>to loop the song <a class='underline' target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/1m8IyfG925Q?si=JmriYHW1AX0aO9nO&t=21'>Baby Shark</a> on every computer on the planet</strong> 🦈​, generating chaos, disorder, and global panic. Technology authorities have deployed all their resources to stop them, but the clock is ticking against them. The latest intelligence reports indicate that the cyberattack will begin in a few hours, and if it isn’t stopped in time, the disruption will be irreversible.",
      description2: "However, there is one last hope. The criminals have protected their creation with a <strong>four-digit secret code</strong> 🔑 that can deactivate the virus’s spread. <strong>Each cybercriminal keeps a single digit on their personal computer</strong>. Security teams have managed to remotely access these devices, but the cybercriminals have installed an <strong>extremely sophisticated security Chatbot</strong>, designed to prevent any intruder from accessing their files.",
      description3: "<strong>Your mission</strong> 🕵️‍♂️ is clear but dangerous: enter each of the four computers, <strong>face their Chatbots, and retrieve the password</strong> before it’s too late. Be careful, <strong>time is limited</strong> ⏰: only 10 minutes of access per computer. Additionally, <strong>the battery of each device ⚡ is critical</strong>, and if the devices run out of power, we will lose access. A single mistake could mean losing the chance to stop the virus forever. Every interaction must be precise and strategic, because one wrong move could seal humanity’s fate to the rhythm of an endless song.",
      description4: "The world depends on your skill, ingenuity, and speed. If you manage to gather all four digits and crack the final code, <strong>you will be able to neutralize the virus and save humanity</strong> from the most absurd cyber chaos ever imagined. Every second counts, and every decision could be the difference between order and a global reign of <a class='underline' target='_blank' href='https://youtu.be/1m8IyfG925Q?si=JmriYHW1AX0aO9nO&t=21'>Baby Shark</a>.",
